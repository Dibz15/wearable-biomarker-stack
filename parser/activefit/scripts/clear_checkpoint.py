"""
One-off script: deletes all sync_check checkpoint points for a user
AND parser source, forcing the next parser sync to fall back to
QUERY_DURATION instead of resuming from wherever the checkpoint
currently points.

RELEVANT RIGHT NOW if you're deploying the HUAMI_ACTIVITY_TIMESTAMPS_ARE_MS
fix (see app/gadgetbridge_to_influxdb.py's config section): the
per-device checkpoint has already been advanced to "recent" by every
OTHER section that was successfully syncing this whole time (stress,
SpO2, temperature, HRV, PAI all worked - only activity was silently
broken). That means simply restarting the parser after the fix will
NOT backfill the activity backlog that built up while it was broken -
it'll just start correctly capturing NEW activity data going forward,
permanently missing everything before that. Run this script, set
QUERY_DURATION wide enough to cover the gap (see below), and restart
once to recover it.

Since the multi-device restructure, checkpoints are scoped by a
`source` tag (e.g. "colmi", "activefit") as well as `user` - see
parser/common/checkpoint.py's module docstring. This script reads
PARSER_SOURCE from the environment (same as the parser container it's
run in) and only clears that source's checkpoints, so clearing the
ring's checkpoint doesn't also wipe out an unrelated device's.

This does NOT by itself trigger a full-history resync - QUERY_DURATION
is the "no checkpoint found" fallback bound, and it defaults to just
86400s (1 day), meant for bootstrapping a brand-new install, not for
"resync everything". To actually recover older data, set
QUERY_DURATION (in your .env, passed through to the parser container)
to something wide enough to cover however far back you need BEFORE
restarting the parser after running this script.

Note this affects every sensor type, not just sleep stages - the next
sync will re-extract and re-write HR, SpO2, stress, HRV, temperature,
activity, and sleep data across the whole widened window. This is
harmless (InfluxDB overwrites identical points rather than
duplicating), just means the next sync will take noticeably longer and
write far more points than a normal 15-30min incremental sync.

Usage:
    docker cp parser/activefit/scripts/clear_checkpoint.py biomarker-parser-activefit:/tmp/clear_checkpoint.py
    docker exec -it biomarker-parser-activefit python3 /tmp/clear_checkpoint.py
    # then, in .env: temporarily set QUERY_DURATION to cover the
    # history you need, e.g. 1209600 for 14 days, and restart the
    # parser container.
