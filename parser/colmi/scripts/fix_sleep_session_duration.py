"""
One-off maintenance script: corrects sleep_session_duration_s values
already written to InfluxDB before the ms-to-seconds conversion fix in
gadgetbridge_to_influxdb.py (see raw_duration_to_seconds()).

Why this is needed: the buggy version stored a raw millisecond
difference (WAKEUP_TIME - TIMESTAMP) directly into a field labelled
"_s" (seconds). An 8.5-hour sleep session was stored as 30,600,000
instead of 30,600 - Grafana's "s" unit formatter then displayed it as
"50.8 weeks". The parser code is fixed going forward, but checkpoint-
based sync (see the README's "Checkpointed sync" section) won't
naturally revisit and correct sessions that were already written
before the fix - this script does that correction directly.

Unlike the sleep_stage cleanup script, this is a WRITE-based fix, not a
delete: sleep_session_duration_s is a FIELD (not a tag), so the
"point identity" (measurement+tags+timestamp) hasn't changed between
the wrong value and the corrected one - overwriting with the corrected
value at the same point is enough, no deletion needed.

IMPORTANT: the corrected value is written as an int, not a float.
InfluxDB locks a field's type on first write - this field was
originally written as an integer (plain int subtraction in the buggy
code), and a later write of a Python float to that same field name is
a hard type conflict InfluxDB rejects outright (422 Unprocessable
Entity), not something it silently coerces. Python's `/` always
returns float even for exact division, so this uses round() instead
to guarantee an int.

Usage:
    docker cp parser/colmi/scripts/fix_sleep_session_duration.py biomarker-parser-colmi:/tmp/fix.py
    docker exec -it biomarker-parser-colmi python3 /tmp/fix.py

Safe to run multiple times - a session whose value already looks
correct (under REASONABLE_MAX_SECONDS) is left untouched.
